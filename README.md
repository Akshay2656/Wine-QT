# Wine-QT
## 📌 Project Overview

Wine quality is influenced by several measurable chemical features such as acidity, sugar content, sulfur dioxide, and alcohol percentage.
In this project, we analyze these factors and build a model that predicts the wine’s quality score using data science and machine learning techniques.


## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 12 columns, where 11 are input variables and 1 is output (target).

🔹 Input Variables (Physicochemical Tests)

Free sulfur dioxide

Total sulfur dioxide

Density

pH

Sulphates


## 🛠 Technologies Used

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code





Alcohol

🔹 Output Variable (Sensory Data)

Quality – (score between 0 and 10)
