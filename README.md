# Wine-QT
📌 Project Overview

Wine quality is influenced by several measurable chemical features such as acidity, sugar content, sulfur dioxide, and alcohol percentage.
In this project, we analyze these factors and build a model that predicts the wine’s quality score using data science and machine learning techniques.
